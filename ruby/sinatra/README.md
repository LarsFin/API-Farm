# Ruby > Sinatra

### Running

Install the `sinatra` gem. Then simply run `app.rb`!

```shell
ruby app.rb
```

### Testing

TODO

### Linting

Ensure you have installed the `rubocop` gem. Then simply run the following line in your command line.

```shell
rubocop
```

### Docker üê≥

It is possible to run the api server, source code testing and linting of code base using docker. In a bash terminal you can use the scripts found in `./scripts` to build new images and run existing images!

**Building an Image**

To build an image, you can run the `./scripts/build_img.sh` script in a bash terminal (make sure to run it from the `ruby/sinatra` directory). It takes an argument of the envrionment you wish to prepare `dev` or `prod` (production lacks any of the dev & test gem dependencies). If you wish to run linting or unit tests; use `dev`, otherwise use `prod` as the build times and image size is smaller. Not providing an argument will default to `dev`.

```
./scripts/build_img.sh <env>
```

If the image already exists, it will remove it and build a fresh image.

**Running an Image**

To run an existing image, you can run the `./scripts/run_img.sh` script in a bash terminal (make sure to run it from the `ruby/sinatra` directory). It takes an argument for the kind of process you wish to run. The available options are; `run_prod`, `run_dev`, `test` or `lint`. It will default to `run_dev` if no argument is provided. The latter three commands require an existing image `ruby/sinatra:dev` where as the first command needs the image `ruby/sinatra:prod`. If these images do not exist; it will exit with a failure code.

```
./scripts/run_img.sh <cmd>
```

When run, the ports on 8080 will be exposed for access. Additionally, all processes run via the script instruct Docker to delete the running container after the process has exited.
